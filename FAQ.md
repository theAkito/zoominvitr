## Why is this project licenced under [AGPL-3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/)?

It is licensed under this licence, because Zoom is a proprietary product with lots of users for no other reason, than, for example, Microsoft Windows became so popular.
Needless to say, such products are made by companies which don't give a damn about you & just want to suck every single last penny out of your pockets.

I do not want to help grow such businesses in any way beyond what I need to do for business I shall not avoid.

The reason I created this project is the grade of necessity. I would prefer to not use a product from a company like the one standing behind Zoom, at all.
